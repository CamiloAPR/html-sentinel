# HTML Sentinel 🔎🦟❌

Introducing HTML Sentinel, a helpful HTML regression tool specifically designed for web developers who, like me, have struggled with comparing HTML snapshots to ensure it's safe to push large site-wide changes to production. This tool makes it easier to compare the HTML generated by your changes before pushing, saving you valuable time. It is useful for two main scenarios:

- 🔄 **Comparing Git Branches Locally**: Compare different Git branches of the same site on your local machine.

- 🌐 **Comparing Different Environments**: Compare two different environments of a website (e.g., staging and production).

HTML Sentinel's primary purpose is to catch HTML changes that might go unnoticed until they cause issues on live sites. By utilizing a JSON configuration file, you can easily set up and customize the tool according to your specific needs. This tool aims to simplify your web development workflow when rolling out large optimizations or sitewide improvements.

The code is straightforward and concise, leaving room for further improvements.

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

### The report is freezing on the browser? ❄️

It's likely that there are too many differences to process, which is something I aim to address and improve.

### Is there a roadmap for this project? 🗺️

Yes and no. While there isn't a formal roadmap, the project will continue to evolve based on user needs and contributions.

### What do I do if I want to contribute? 🤝

Feel free to post your issues or create a Pull Request with your ideas and contributions.

### Why React.js for the reports? Isn't it a little bit overkill? 🤔

Yes, I admit that using React.js for the reports might seem like overkill. When I first built this tool in 2021, I wanted to explore React and saw this as a good opportunity to do so.
